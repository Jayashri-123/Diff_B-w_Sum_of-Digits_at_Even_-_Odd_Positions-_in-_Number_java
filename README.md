This Java application calculates the "difference between the sum of digits at even and odd positions in a given number". 
The positions are 1-based, meaning the first digit of the number is considered to be at position 1 (odd), 
the second digit at position 2 (even), and so on.

Features
Input Handling: Accepts any positive integer number.
Calculation: Computes the sum of digits at odd positions and even positions separately.
Output: Displays the difference between these two sums.
